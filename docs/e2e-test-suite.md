## AI Agent Execution Notes

### Browser Automation Tools
The AI agent should use Playwright MCP tools:
- `browser_navigate` - Navigate to URLs
- `browser_snapshot` - Get page state for verification
- `browser_click` - Interact with buttons/links
- `browser_type` - Enter text in forms
- `browser_fill_form` - Fill multiple form fields
- `browser_wait_for` - Wait for elements/text
- `browser_evaluate` - Run JavaScript for complex checks

### API Testing
For API tests, use the `Bash` tool with `curl`:
```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/api/streams
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/admin/login -d '{"password":"..."}' -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

### Verification Strategy
1. **Visual Verification:** Use `browser_snapshot` to capture page state
2. **API Verification:** Make follow-up API calls to confirm changes
3. **Database Verification:** Query Prisma/database if needed
4. **Network Verification:** Check console/network logs for errors

### Error Handling
- If a test fails, capture screenshot and console logs
- Note the exact step that failed
- Continue with remaining tests if failure is isolated
- Abort suite if critical dependency fails (e.g., health check)

### Reporting
After each test, report:
- Test name and ID
- PASS/FAIL status
- Execution time
- Screenshots/evidence for failures
- Any warnings or unexpected behavior
